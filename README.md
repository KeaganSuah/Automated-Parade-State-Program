# Automated-Parade-State-Program
Every morning, employees will post their status on Google forums, which allows multiple users to post at the same time. The Forums data is linked to the Google sheet. This program will then extract these data from Google Sheets, authenticate the personnel data, and clean the raw dirty data, which may contain duplicates or unrecognizable personnel. After that, the clean data will be formatted and structured into a table format. The program's functions will assist in using the table and generating the parade state as well as the parade state summary, which is updated daily.
